Hey Guys. This is my first ever react website/ app. It is a super simple and also a small project. I have worked for 1 day to create that. I know I have taken a long time cause it was my first react app. The designs are not so much unique but super simple. I have used Sass for it. It has also a dark mode which will give you a more better user experienece. So try it.

After all thank you so much and don't forget to give it a star if you have liked it.
